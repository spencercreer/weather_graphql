## Description
OpenWeather API weather application.

This application retrieves weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays it to the user. It displays the current and 5-day forecasts for a searched city. The current forecast includes the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index. The UV index indicates whether conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.

The application prepends the searched city to a list and stores it in local storage. When the application is run, the last searched city's forecast is displayed.
